Currently there is a cache mechanism in BlobSatd, at the end of a complete repository scan it stores which objectId has at least a satd inside
So, if a following scan will happen again, it will load and exploit the cache to parse only those sources we already know contains a satd

A much faster cache would store which commits contains a satd-nonSatd pair; thanks to this we can avoid the very expensive operation
of the two tree diff (see DiffFormatter usage in this project)

Beware the two caches are not compatible.
